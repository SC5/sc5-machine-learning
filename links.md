# Machine Learning Links

A link list of machine learning resources, curated by the ML team at SC5.

### AI & Machine learning history

* [AI, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning: A Primer](http://a16z.com/2016/06/10/ai-deep-learning-machines/) - A 45 minute video on the history behind AI and machine learning. A must-watch for anyone interested in the field.


### Opinion pieces

* [What Artificial Intelligence Can and Canâ€™t Do Right Now](https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-artificial-intelligence-can-and-cant-do-right-now) - A down-to-earth explanation of what's currently possible (and not possible). Focuses mostly on supervised learning.

* [Ten Myths About Machine Learning](https://medium.com/@pedromdd/ten-myths-about-machine-learning-d888b48334a3#.udop91xpg) - _Everyone_ should read this before blinding trusting everything reported by the media. By Pedro Domingos.

### Deep Learning

* [An Introduction to Deep Learning](http://blog.algorithmia.com/introduction-to-deep-learning-2016/) - A good, plain English overview of deep learning.
* [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org) - _The_ book on deep neural networks. Covers all of the maths, intuition and lots of different architectures. If you aren't comfortable with matrices and linear algebra, it'd be a good idea to read up on those first before picking this up.
* [Deep Learning Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b99UVkWzYTQ&list=PLjJh1vlSEYgvGod9wWiydumYl8hOXixNu) - A video series that gives a non-technical explanation of deep learning. Highly recommended for beginners.
* [A Tutorial on Deep Learning (PDF)](https://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/tutorial1.pdf) - A great 2-part series by Quoc V Le on Deep Learning. Covers the basics and some more advanced algorithms such as convolutional neural networks, autoencoders and recurrent neural networks. Part 2 can be found [here](https://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/tutorial2.pdf).
* [Nuts and Bolts of Apllying Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ka6a13S9I) - A one-hour workshop video in which the legendary Andrew Ng explains the practical issues surrounding Deep Learning, along with tips on how to solve them.


### Reinforcement learning

* [Reinforcement Learning by David Silver from DeepMind](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwQyV9I_3POuVsyB3hCyl3Iieb1oWVfPP) - A great series of videos (15 hours) on reinforcement learning by David Silver. Technical, but very much worth it. A great place to start if you're a beginner. Requires some math knowledge, but don't let that deter you. The slides for the lectures can be found [here](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html).
* [Demystifying Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://neuro.cs.ut.ee/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/) - A good tutorial that focuses on Q-learning using deep neural networks.
* [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/the-book-2nd.html) - A comprehensive book detailing lots of different reinforcement learning algorithms and techniques.


### Natural language processing

* [Embed, encode, attend, predict: The new deep learning formula for state-of-the-art NLP models](https://explosion.ai/blog/deep-learning-formula-nlp) - Does what it says on the tin. Rather complex, but a good read if you have intermediate knowledge of neural networks and NLP concepts.


### Neural networks

* [The Neural Network Zoo](http://www.asimovinstitute.org/neural-network-zoo/) - A great blog post that visualises different types of neural networks, along with well-written descriptions explaining why you might want to choose one over the other.
